Faremeter: Frictionless Agentic Payments
=========================================

Do you need to:

- Charge AI agents for use of existing resources or data.
- Accept micropayments for services.

... if so, Faremeter can unlock new revenue opportunites for you.

## Where We Deploy

Faremeter can enable payment strategies wherever you need them. It can deploy with:

- Any existing HTTP service
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Hono](https://hono.dev/)
- [Val Town](https://www.val.town/dashboard)
- Wallet providers like [Crossmint](https://www.crossmint.com/), [Squads](https://squads.xyz/), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)

## What We Support

- Solana
- Base-Sepolia
- Coinbase's x402
- Base-mainnet (coming soon)
- SKALE Europa Testnet
- SKALE Europa Mainnet (coming soon)
- Cloudflare's Pay-Per-Crawl (coming soon)
- L402 (coming soon)

... and a host of other facilitators, middleware, and blockchains.

## How It Works

Faremeter takes existing and emerging standards to create a plugin system for HTTP
and the existing `402 Payment Required` concepts that is standard, wallet, and blockchain agnostic.

[Faremeter](https://github.com/faremeter/faremeter/) is a collection of libraries, tools, and applications designed to allow agents and other utilities to transparently make web3 payments using web2 infrastructure.

Published packages include:
- [@faremeter/fetch](https://github.com/faremeter/faremeter/blob/main/packages/fetch) - a pluggable client library
- [@faremeter/middleware](https://github.com/faremeter/faremeter/blob/main/packages/middleware) - a configurable middleware
- [@faremeter/facilitator](https://github.com/faremeter/faremeter/blob/main/packages/facilitator) - a configurable facilitator
